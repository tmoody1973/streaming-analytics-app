## 🎙️ Making Radio Analytics Accessible: How AI Could Transform Public Radio's Data Analysis

I just built something that could change how public radio stations work with their audience data.

**The Problem:**
Every week, radio stations get Nielsen ratings data in CSV files. To answer questions like "How does our morning drive perform compared to midday?" you need to:
- Export the data to Excel
- Create pivot tables
- Build charts manually
- Or hire a data analyst

**What if you could just ask?**

I built a dashboard where you literally type questions in plain English and get instant visualizations:

- "Compare WYMS-FM vs WYMS-HD2 by hour"
- "What are our best performing time slots?"
- "Show me audience trends for the past month"

**Instantly. No Excel. No SQL. No waiting.**

---

## How It Works (In Plain English)

### The User Experience

1. **Upload your Nielsen CSV** - Just drag and drop
2. **Ask questions in natural language** - Like talking to a colleague who knows SQL
3. **Get instant visualizations** - Charts, graphs, and insights appear on a canvas you can rearrange
4. **Save your dashboards** - Come back later, your analysis is waiting

### What Happens Behind the Scenes

I combined three technologies that are reshaping how we work with data:

**1. AI That Understands Radio Metrics**
- Built on Thesys C1 (generative UI technology)
- Trained to understand radio-specific terms (CUME, TLH, TSL, AAS)
- Recognizes common questions: comparisons, trends, rankings

**2. Smart SQL Templates (Not the Wild West)**
- Instead of letting AI write any SQL it wants (dangerous!)
- Created 4 safe "templates" for common radio queries:
  - Compare stations
  - Find best time slots
  - Station performance overview
  - Trend analysis

**3. Real-Time Database (Supabase)**
- Your data lives in a secure cloud database
- No more emailing Excel files around
- Everyone sees the same data
- Updates in real-time

### Why Templates Instead of "Pure AI"?

I researched letting AI write any SQL query it wants (using tools like LangChain).

**The honest trade-off:**
- ✅ **Templates:** Safe, fast, predictable, cover 90% of questions
- ⚠️ **Pure AI:** Flexible but can write dangerous queries, slower, unpredictable

**For radio analytics, templates win.** Our questions are predictable:
- "Compare stations"
- "Best hours"
- "Trends over time"

Why overcomplicate it?

## The Technology Stack (For Tech-Curious Folks)

- **Frontend:** Next.js + tldraw (infinite canvas for dashboards)
- **AI:** Thesys C1 (generative UI, not just chatbot responses)
- **Database:** Supabase (PostgreSQL with real-time features)
- **Query Layer:** Custom SQL templates (safe, optimized)
- **Hosting:** Vercel (deploys in seconds)

**Total cost to run:** ~$20-50/month for a small station

---

## What This Could Mean for Public Radio

### Immediate Impact

**Time Savings:**
- Programming directors: Hours → Minutes for weekly analysis
- GMs: Instant answers during board meetings
- Development: Quick insights for donor targeting

**Better Decisions:**
- See patterns you'd miss in Excel
- Test scheduling ideas quickly
- Compare performance across platforms (FM, HD, streaming)

### Bigger Picture Potential

Imagine if public radio had tools like Netflix or Spotify:

**Station Level:**
- Real-time audience monitoring
- A/B testing for program schedules
- Automated weekly performance reports

**Network Level:**
- Compare performance across member stations
- Share best practices based on actual data
- Collective intelligence for programming

**Industry Level:**
- Benchmark against similar-sized stations
- Identify trends across public radio
- Make data-driven advocacy for public media

---

## Why This Matters Now

**Three trends are converging:**

1. **AI is finally useful** - Not hype, actual productivity gains
2. **Cloud databases are cheap** - What cost $10k/month now costs $20
3. **Open-source tools are excellent** - No need to hire a dev team

**Public radio can compete with commercial stations' analytics capabilities** - without their budgets.

---

## The Honest Limitations

**This isn't magic:**
- Only works with structured data (CSV files from Nielsen, etc.)
- Templates limit flexibility (by design, for safety)
- Needs someone to upload data regularly
- AI can make mistakes (always verify critical decisions)

**This isn't trying to replace analysts** - it's trying to make basic analysis accessible to everyone else.

---

## What's Next?

I'm exploring:
- **Automated data imports** (no manual uploads)
- **More template types** (demographic analysis, device breakdowns)
- **Multi-station comparisons** (for networks)
- **Scheduled reports** (weekly snapshots emailed)

**But mostly, I want to learn:**
- What questions do PD's actually ask?
- What would make this useful for you?
- What am I missing?

## Try It Yourself

The code is open source: [GitHub Link]

**Or just tell me:**
- What questions do you ask your ratings data?
- What takes too long in Excel?
- What insights do you wish you had time to find?

## For Public Radio Tech Folks

**Want to build something similar?**

The architecture is surprisingly simple:
1. Supabase for data storage (replaces Excel)
2. SQL templates for safe queries (replaces data analyst for common questions)
3. C1 for natural language + visualization (replaces manual chart creation)

**Total build time:** ~2 weeks part-time

**Hardest parts:**
- Getting AI to consistently generate visualizations (prompt engineering is 80% of the work)
- Schema design (making sure data imports work smoothly)
- Not overthinking it (templates > pure AI for this use case)

## The Big Question

**If small stations had enterprise-level analytics tools, what would you build?**

I think we're at an inflection point where AI makes sophisticated data tools accessible to organizations that couldn't afford them before.

**Public radio has incredible data** - listener surveys, streaming analytics, Nielsen ratings, donor databases.

**What if that data was as easy to query as asking a question?**

Let's find out.

## Discussion Questions for Public Radio Professionals

1. **What questions do you currently export data to answer?**
   - How long does it take?
   - What insights are you missing because it's too much work?

2. **What would "AI analytics" need to do to be useful at your station?**
   - What features matter?
   - What would be gimmicky?

3. **What concerns would you have about AI analyzing your data?**
   - Privacy? Accuracy? Trust?
   - How would you validate AI-generated insights?

4. **If this was a shared tool across public radio, what would you want?**
   - Compare to similar stations?
   - Industry benchmarks?
   - Best practices library?

## Alternative Shorter Version (If You Want Something More Concise)

---

**I built an AI dashboard that lets radio programmers analyze Nielsen data by asking questions in plain English.**

"Compare WYMS-FM vs WYMS-HD2 by hour" → instant chart

No Excel. No pivot tables. No waiting for the analyst to get back to you.

**Tech stack:**
- Thesys C1 (AI that generates visualizations)
- Supabase (cloud database)
- Custom SQL templates (safe, predictable queries)
- Next.js (modern web framework)

**Why templates instead of "pure AI"?**
Radio analytics questions are predictable (comparisons, trends, rankings). Templates cover 90% of use cases safely. No risk of AI writing dangerous queries.

**What this could mean for public radio:**
- Hours → Minutes for weekly analysis
- Data-driven scheduling decisions
- Accessible insights without hiring analysts
- Tools that compete with commercial stations' capabilities

**The bigger picture:**
AI + cheap cloud tools = enterprise analytics for small station budgets

**What questions would YOU ask your ratings data if it was this easy?**

## Potential Objections (And How to Address)

**"AI isn't accurate enough for critical decisions"**
→ Agree! This is for exploratory analysis, not replacing human judgment. Always verify critical insights.

**"Our data is too messy for this"**
→ True for many stations. That's actually the first problem to solve - standardizing data formats.

**"We can't afford another tool"**
→ This could cost ~$20-50/month if self-hosted. Less than one hour of staff time saved pays for itself.

**"This would eliminate analyst jobs"**
→ It eliminates the boring parts (Excel formatting, manual charts). Analysts can focus on deeper questions and recommendations.

**"How do we know the AI isn't hallucinating?"**
→ SQL templates ensure queries are real and correct. AI only generates visualizations, not the underlying data.
