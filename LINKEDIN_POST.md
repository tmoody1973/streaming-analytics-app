## 🎙️ Making Radio Analytics Accessible: How AI Could Transform Public Radio's Data Analysis

I just built something that could change how public radio stations work with their audience data.

**The Problem:**
Every week, radio stations get Nielsen ratings data in CSV files. To answer questions like "How does our morning drive perform compared to midday?" you need to:
- Export the data to Excel
- Create pivot tables
- Build charts manually
- Or hire a data analyst

**What if you could just ask?**

I built a dashboard where you literally type questions in plain English and get instant visualizations:

- "Compare WYMS-FM vs WYMS-HD2 by hour"
- "What are our best performing time slots?"
- "Show me audience trends for the past month"

**Instantly. No Excel. No SQL. No waiting.**

---

## How It Works (In Plain English)

### The User Experience

1. **Upload your Nielsen CSV** - Just drag and drop
2. **Ask questions in natural language** - Like talking to a colleague who knows SQL
3. **Get instant visualizations** - Charts, graphs, and insights appear on an infinite canvas
4. **Organize visually** - Drag charts around, arrange them spatially, create multiple dashboard layouts
5. **Save your dashboards** - Come back later, your analysis is waiting exactly where you left it

### What Happens Behind the Scenes

I combined three technologies that are reshaping how we work with data:

**1. Thesys C1 - AI That Creates Visual Interfaces**

Instead of a chatbot that just gives you text responses, C1 generates actual interactive components - charts, tables, cards - as React code in real-time.

**What this means in practice:**
- You type "Compare WYMS-FM vs WYMS-HD2 by hour"
- C1 doesn't just describe the data - it *creates* a line chart component
- The chart appears instantly on your canvas as a draggable card
- It's trained to understand radio-specific terms (CUME, TLH, TSL, AAS)
- Recognizes common questions: comparisons, trends, rankings

**Why this is different from ChatGPT:**
- ChatGPT gives you text
- C1 gives you actual, working visualizations
- No copy-pasting code - the UI appears instantly

**2. Smart SQL Templates (Not the Wild West)**
- Instead of letting AI write any SQL it wants (dangerous!)
- Created 4 safe "templates" for common radio queries:
  - Compare stations
  - Find best time slots
  - Station performance overview
  - Trend analysis

**3. Real-Time Database (Supabase)**
- Your data lives in a secure cloud database
- No more emailing Excel files around
- Everyone sees the same data
- Updates in real-time

### Why Templates Instead of "Pure AI"?

I researched letting AI write any SQL query it wants (using tools like LangChain).

**The honest trade-off:**
- ✅ **Templates:** Safe, fast, predictable, cover 90% of questions
- ⚠️ **Pure AI (LangChain):** Flexible but can write dangerous queries, slower, unpredictable

**For radio analytics, templates win.** Our questions are predictable:
- "Compare stations"
- "Best hours"
- "Trends over time"

**But templates have limits.** If users start asking truly unpredictable questions like:
- "Show me stations where CUME increased but TLH decreased in the last 3 weeks"
- "Find hours where 414 Music outperforms both WYMS stations combined"

Then it might be time to explore **LangChain's text-to-SQL** - which lets AI generate custom SQL queries on the fly. More powerful, but needs careful safeguards against bad queries.

**Current approach:** Start simple with templates, upgrade to LangChain only if we outgrow them.

## The Technology Stack (For Tech-Curious Folks)

- **Frontend:** Next.js + tldraw v4 (infinite canvas library)
- **AI:** Thesys C1 (generative UI, not just chatbot responses)
- **Database:** Supabase (PostgreSQL with real-time features)
- **Query Layer:** Custom SQL templates (safe, optimized)
- **Hosting:** Vercel (deploys in seconds)

**What makes the infinite canvas special:**
- Think Miro or FigJam, but for data dashboards
- Drag charts anywhere - organize spatially, not in fixed grids
- Zoom in/out to see overview or focus on details
- Multiple dashboard "rooms" on the same canvas
- Save layouts - your spatial organization persists

**Example workflow:**
- Left side: daily performance charts
- Right side: week-over-week comparisons
- Top corner: quick reference tables
- Zoom out to see everything at once, zoom in to analyze details

**Total cost to run:** ~$20-50/month for a small station

---

## What This Could Mean for Public Radio

### Immediate Impact

**Time Savings:**
- Programming directors: Hours → Minutes for weekly analysis
- GMs: Instant answers during board meetings
- Development: Quick insights for donor targeting

**Better Decisions:**
- See patterns you'd miss in Excel
- Test scheduling ideas quickly
- Compare performance across platforms (FM, HD, streaming)

### Bigger Picture Potential

Imagine if public radio had tools like Netflix or Spotify:

**Station Level:**
- Real-time audience monitoring
- A/B testing for program schedules
- Automated weekly performance reports

**Network Level:**
- Compare performance across member stations
- Share best practices based on actual data
- Collective intelligence for programming

**Industry Level:**
- Benchmark against similar-sized stations
- Identify trends across public radio
- Make data-driven advocacy for public media

---

## Why This Matters Now

**Three trends are converging:**

1. **AI is finally useful** - Not hype, actual productivity gains
2. **Cloud databases are cheap** - What cost $10k/month now costs $20
3. **Open-source tools are excellent** - No need to hire a dev team

**Public radio can compete with commercial stations' analytics capabilities** - without their budgets.

---

## The Honest Limitations

**This isn't magic:**
- Only works with structured data (CSV files from Nielsen, etc.)
- Templates limit flexibility (by design, for safety)
- Needs someone to upload data regularly
- AI can make mistakes (always verify critical decisions)

**This isn't trying to replace analysts** - it's trying to make basic analysis accessible to everyone else.

---

## This is a Prototype - Imagine the Possibilities

**Important:** This is an MVP (minimum viable product) built in 2 weeks part-time. It proves the concept works.

**But here's where it gets really interesting...**

### The Bigger Vision: Connected Data Ecosystem

Right now, this analyzes Nielsen ratings. But the same architecture could connect:

**📊 Audience Data:**
- Nielsen ratings (done!)
- Streaming analytics (Triton, NPR One)
- Podcast downloads
- Website traffic

**💰 Fundraising Data:**
- CRM systems (Salesforce, Greater Giving)
- Donor databases
- Pledge drive performance
- Member retention rates

**📻 Programming Data:**
- Show schedules
- Underwriting spots
- Content types
- Guest appearances

**Imagine asking:**

- "Which shows convert the most listeners to donors?"
- "What's our audience-to-member conversion rate by daypart?"
- "Compare donor retention for morning drive vs evening programs"
- "Show me listener demographics for our top fundraising shows"

**The question isn't IF this is possible** - it's about building it thoughtfully, with privacy and accuracy in mind.

### Why This Matters for Public Radio

Commercial radio has expensive analytics suites that connect all their data. **Public radio doesn't.**

**What if we built the open-source version?**

- Shared tool across member stations
- Open standards for data integration
- Privacy-first design
- Cost: fraction of commercial tools

### What I'm Learning Now

- **Which integrations matter most?** (CRM vs streaming vs social media?)
- **Privacy concerns?** (How do we protect listener/donor data?)
- **What questions drive actual decisions?** (Not just "nice to know")
- **Who would use this?** (PD? GM? Development? All of them?)
- **When to upgrade to full AI SQL?** (Currently using safe templates - exploring LangChain for more flexible queries)

**This is a prototype** - I want your input before building more.

## Try It Yourself

The code is open source: [GitHub Link]

**Or just tell me:**
- What questions do you ask your ratings data?
- What takes too long in Excel?
- What insights do you wish you had time to find?

## For Public Radio Tech Folks

**Want to build something similar?**

The architecture is surprisingly simple:
1. **Supabase** - Cloud PostgreSQL database (replaces Excel files)
2. **SQL templates** - Safe, predefined queries for common questions
3. **C1 GenUI** - AI that generates React chart components from natural language
4. **tldraw** - Infinite canvas library for organizing visualizations spatially

**What C1 does that's special:**
- You type: "Compare WYMS-FM vs WYMS-HD2 by hour"
- C1 picks the right SQL template → fetches data → generates LineChart component
- The chart appears as actual React code, not an image or static HTML
- It's interactive: hover for details, resize, drag around the canvas

**What the infinite canvas enables:**
- Unlike traditional dashboards with fixed layouts (rows/columns)
- You can arrange charts however makes sense to YOU
- Programming director might cluster morning drive charts on the left
- Development director might group fundraising metrics in another area
- Zoom out to see patterns across your whole analysis space

**Total build time:** ~2 weeks part-time

**Hardest parts:**
- Getting C1 to consistently generate visualizations (prompt engineering is 80% of the work)
- Schema design (making sure CSV imports map to clean database tables)
- Not overthinking it (templates > pure AI for this use case)

**Future explorations:**
- **LangChain text-to-SQL** - If users ask questions my 4 templates can't handle, LangChain could let AI write custom SQL queries from natural language. Researching safe implementation strategies.

## The Big Question

**If small stations had enterprise-level analytics tools, what would you build?**

I think we're at an inflection point where AI makes sophisticated data tools accessible to organizations that couldn't afford them before.

**Public radio has incredible data** - listener surveys, streaming analytics, Nielsen ratings, donor databases.

**What if that data was as easy to query as asking a question?**

Let's find out.

## Alternative Shorter Version (If You Want Something More Concise)

---

**I built an AI dashboard that lets radio programmers analyze Nielsen data by asking questions in plain English.**

"Compare WYMS-FM vs WYMS-HD2 by hour" → instant chart

No Excel. No pivot tables. No waiting for the analyst to get back to you.

**Tech stack:**
- Thesys C1 (AI that generates actual chart components, not just text)
- tldraw (infinite canvas - arrange charts spatially like Miro)
- Supabase (cloud database)
- Custom SQL templates (safe, predictable queries)
- Next.js (modern web framework)

**Why templates instead of "pure AI"?**
Radio analytics questions are predictable (comparisons, trends, rankings). Templates cover 90% of use cases safely. No risk of AI writing dangerous queries.

**Future consideration:** If users need more flexibility, I'm exploring LangChain's text-to-SQL capabilities to let AI generate custom queries for complex questions templates can't handle.

**What this could mean for public radio:**
- Hours → Minutes for weekly analysis
- Data-driven scheduling decisions
- Accessible insights without hiring analysts
- Tools that compete with commercial stations' capabilities

**The bigger picture:**
AI + cheap cloud tools = enterprise analytics for small station budgets

**What questions would YOU ask your ratings data if it was this easy?**

## Potential Objections (And How to Address)

**"AI isn't accurate enough for critical decisions"**
→ Agree! This is for exploratory analysis, not replacing human judgment. Always verify critical insights.

**"Our data is too messy for this"**
→ True for many stations. That's actually the first problem to solve - standardizing data formats.

**"We can't afford another tool"**
→ This could cost ~$20-50/month if self-hosted. Less than one hour of staff time saved pays for itself.

**"This would eliminate analyst jobs"**
→ It eliminates the boring parts (Excel formatting, manual charts). Analysts can focus on deeper questions and recommendations.

**"How do we know the AI isn't hallucinating?"**
→ SQL templates ensure queries are real and correct. AI only generates visualizations, not the underlying data.
