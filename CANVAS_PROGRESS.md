# Canvas Dashboard Implementation Progress

## ✅ Completed Tasks (4/7)

### 1. ✅ Install tldraw and canvas dependencies
- Installed `tldraw` and `@tldraw/tldraw` packages
- Added 89 packages successfully
- Ready for infinite canvas functionality

### 2. ✅ Create new canvas-based main page layout
- **Complete UX overhaul** - replaced dashboard interface with canvas-first design
- Fullscreen tldraw canvas as the main workspace
- Clean top bar with logo and action buttons
- Canvas takes up entire viewport (except top bar)
- **File**: `/app/page.tsx`, `/components/canvas/CanvasWorkspace.tsx`

### 3. ✅ Build CSV upload component for canvas interface
- Created modal-based upload interface
- Drag & drop support
- Real-time upload progress
- Success/error status messages
- Automatically stores data in Supabase
- Shows helpful info about post-upload workflow
- **Files**: `/components/canvas/UploadModal.tsx`

### 4. ✅ Implement Cmd+K prompt interface
- Keyboard shortcut (⌘K / Ctrl+K) triggers command palette
- Clean, focused prompt input
- Suggestion chips for common requests
- ESC to close
- Loading state during chart generation
- **Files**: `/components/canvas/CommandPalette.tsx`

## 🚧 In Progress / Remaining Tasks (3/7)

### 5. 🔄 Integrate Thesys C1 with canvas card generation
**Next Step**: Connect the command palette to Thesys C1 AI
- Call `/api/chat` endpoint when user submits prompt
- Pass user's uploaded data context
- Receive chart specification from AI
- Generate chart visualization

### 6. ⏳ Create chart card components for canvas
**After AI integration**: Build draggable chart cards
- Create card wrapper for charts
- Make cards draggable on tldraw canvas
- Support resize functionality
- Render Nivo charts inside cards

### 7. ⏳ Test complete canvas workflow
**Final step**: End-to-end testing
- Upload CSV → Data stored in Supabase ✅
- Press Cmd+K → Palette opens ✅
- Type prompt → AI generates chart (TODO)
- Chart appears as card on canvas (TODO)
- Drag, resize, arrange cards (TODO)

## Current Architecture

Overlays:
├── Upload Modal (triggered by button)
├── Command Palette (triggered by Cmd+K)
└── Chart Cards (generated by AI)
```

## Key Features Implemented

✅ **Canvas-First Design**
- Infinite workspace powered by tldraw
- No sidebars or cluttered UI
- Focus on building custom dashboards

✅ **Smart Upload System**
- Modal interface doesn't block canvas
- Automatic Supabase storage
- CSV parsing and validation
- Support for radio metrics (CUME, TLH, TSL, etc.)

✅ **Command Palette** (Cmd+K)
- Quick access to AI chart generation
- Keyboard-first workflow
- Contextual suggestions
- Loading states

## What Works Right Now

You can test the following:

### 1. **Canvas Interface**
```bash
Open: http://localhost:3000
```
- See the infinite tldraw canvas
- Use tldraw's built-in tools (draw, shapes, etc.)

### 2. **Upload CSV**
- Click "Upload CSV" button in top bar
- Drag & drop or browse for CSV file
- Watch data get stored in Supabase
- Check console for success message

### 3. **Command Palette**
- Press `⌘K` (Mac) or `Ctrl+K` (Windows/Linux)
- Type a prompt (e.g., "Show CUME trends")
- Click suggestion chips to auto-fill
- Press ESC to close

## What's Next

### Immediate Next Steps:

1. **Connect AI to Command Palette**
   - Modify `handlePromptSubmit` in `app/page.tsx`
   - Call `/api/chat` endpoint
   - Pass uploaded table names as context
   - Parse AI response

2. **Create Chart Card Shape**
   - Build custom tldraw shape for chart cards
   - Integrate Nivo charts
   - Support interactive resize/drag

3. **End-to-End Test**
   - Upload sample radio data CSV
   - Use Cmd+K to request chart
   - Verify chart appears on canvas
   - Test drag/resize functionality

## Files Changed/Created

### New Files:
- `/components/canvas/CanvasWorkspace.tsx` - Main canvas component
- `/components/canvas/UploadModal.tsx` - CSV upload interface
- `/components/canvas/CommandPalette.tsx` - Cmd+K prompt interface

### Modified Files:
- `/app/page.tsx` - Completely rewritten for canvas-first UX
- `/package.json` - Added tldraw dependencies

### Existing Files (Still Work):
- `/app/api/chat/route.ts` - Thesys C1 AI endpoint with tool calling
- `/app/api/supabase/upload-csv/route.ts` - Supabase data storage
- `/app/api/tools/*` - Tool endpoints for AI to query data
- `/app/api/data/upload/route.ts` - CSV processing and storage

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Canvas loads and is interactive
- [ ] Upload CSV button opens modal
- [ ] CSV upload works and stores in Supabase
- [ ] Cmd+K opens command palette
- [ ] Can type in command palette
- [ ] ESC closes command palette
- [ ] AI generates chart from prompt (TODO)
- [ ] Chart appears as card on canvas (TODO)
- [ ] Can drag chart cards (TODO)
- [ ] Can resize chart cards (TODO)

## Notes for Next Session

The foundation is solid. The main remaining work is:

1. **AI Integration** - Connect command palette to existing `/api/chat` endpoint
2. **Custom tldraw Shapes** - Create chart card shapes that can be placed on canvas
3. **Chart Rendering** - Use Nivo (or similar) to render charts inside cards

The good news: All the data infrastructure is already in place from the previous Thesys C1 + Supabase integration. We just need to bridge the canvas UI with the AI backend.

## Status: 57% Complete (4/7 tasks done)

Ready to continue with AI integration and chart card creation.
