## Export Checklist

Before uploading to the Taipy app, ensure each CSV file contains:

- [ ] **Date/Time columns** in a recognizable format
- [ ] **CUME column** (will be averaged automatically)
- [ ] **TLH column** (will be summed automatically)
- [ ] **Active Sessions column** (will be summed automatically)
- [ ] **Dimension columns** (Daypart, Device, etc.)
- [ ] **No missing headers** or empty rows at the top
- [ ] **Consistent naming** across files

## File Naming Convention

Use this naming pattern for easy identification:
```
radio_milwaukee_[analysis_type]_[date_range].csv
```

Examples:
- `radio_milwaukee_daily_overview_last30days.csv`
- `radio_milwaukee_daypart_performance_last30days.csv`
- `radio_milwaukee_device_analysis_last30days.csv`

## Upload Order Recommendation

For best results, upload files in this order:
1. Daily Overview (primary data)
2. Daypart Performance
3. Device Analysis
4. Day of Week Analysis
5. Additional analysis files as needed

This ensures the main dashboard populates first, then additional analysis features become available as you upload more specific data files.

## Station Filtering Requirements for Radio Milwaukee

### Multi-Station Data Management

Radio Milwaukee operates multiple stations and streams that require separate analysis and comparison capabilities. Each CSV export must include proper station identification to enable filtering, comparison, and station-specific analysis.

### Required Station Identifiers in All Exports

**Station/Stream Column**: Every CSV export must include a "Station" or "Stream" column that clearly identifies which Radio Milwaukee property the data represents.

**Consistent Naming Convention**: Use standardized station identifiers across all exports to ensure proper data correlation and analysis.

**Example Station Identifiers:**
- WYMS-FM (88.9 The Bridge)
- WUWM-FM (89.7 NPR News)
- WYMS-HD2 (Alternative Stream)
- WUWM-HD2 (Classical Stream)
- Radio Milwaukee Online Stream
- Radio Milwaukee Mobile App Stream

### Station-Specific Export Strategy

**Individual Station Exports**: Generate separate CSV files for each station when detailed station-specific analysis is required.

**Combined Multi-Station Exports**: Include all stations in single CSV files with proper station identification columns for cross-station comparison.

**Station Filtering in Triton Webcast Explore**: Use Triton's station/stream filtering capabilities to generate both individual and combined exports as needed.

### Updated Export Specifications with Station Filtering

All 22 previously defined CSV exports should be generated with the following station management approaches:

**Approach 1: Station-Specific Files**
Generate separate CSV files for each Radio Milwaukee station:
- `radio_milwaukee_WYMS_daily_overview_18months.csv`
- `radio_milwaukee_WUWM_daily_overview_18months.csv`
- `radio_milwaukee_WYMS_HD2_daily_overview_18months.csv`

**Approach 2: Multi-Station Combined Files**
Generate combined CSV files with station identification columns:
- `radio_milwaukee_all_stations_daily_overview_18months.csv` (with Station column)
- `radio_milwaukee_all_stations_demographics_18months.csv` (with Station column)

**Recommended Implementation**: Use Approach 2 (combined files) for most exports to enable easy cross-station analysis while maintaining the ability to filter by individual stations within the Taipy/Next.js application.

### Station Management in Analytics Application

**Station Selection Interface**: The application should provide intuitive station selection and filtering controls that allow users to analyze individual stations or compare across the Radio Milwaukee portfolio.

**Cross-Station Analysis**: Enable side-by-side comparison of performance metrics across different Radio Milwaukee stations with proper context and strategic insights.

**Station-Specific Dashboards**: Provide dedicated dashboard views for each station while maintaining the ability to switch between stations and view portfolio-wide performance.

**AI Station Awareness**: The CopilotKit AI integration should understand station context and provide station-specific insights and recommendations based on format, target audience, and strategic objectives.

### Strategic Applications for Multi-Station Analysis

**Portfolio Performance**: Analyze overall Radio Milwaukee performance across all stations while identifying individual station strengths and opportunities.

**Format Comparison**: Compare performance between different station formats (NPR news vs music) to understand audience preferences and optimize programming strategies.

**Resource Allocation**: Use cross-station performance data to inform resource allocation, programming investments, and strategic planning decisions.

**Competitive Positioning**: Understand how different Radio Milwaukee stations perform against market competitors in their respective formats and demographics.

**Audience Development**: Identify opportunities for cross-promotion between stations and develop strategies for growing audience across the entire Radio Milwaukee portfolio.

This multi-station approach ensures that Radio Milwaukee can analyze both individual station performance and portfolio-wide strategic opportunities while maintaining the flexibility to focus on specific stations when detailed analysis is required.
