File processing should occur both client-side for immediate validation and server-side for comprehensive analysis. The system should support multiple CSV formats from Triton Webcast Metrics with real-time progress indicators and detailed error reporting.

**Upload Features:**
- Drag-and-drop interface with visual feedback
- Multiple file selection and batch processing
- Real-time upload progress with file-by-file status
- Client-side validation before server processing
- Automatic file type detection and format validation

#### Radio Metrics Processing

Server-side API routes must implement proper radio industry calculations with strict adherence to CUME averaging rules. The processing engine should handle large datasets efficiently while maintaining data integrity and providing detailed calculation logs for transparency.

**Calculation Engine:**
```typescript
interface RadioMetrics {
  cume: number; // Always averaged, never summed
  tlh: number;  // Total Listening Hours (can be summed)
  tsl: number;  // Calculated as TLH รท CUME
  activeSessions: number;
  date: Date;
  daypart?: string;
  device?: string;
}
```

#### Interactive Dashboard Components

React components should provide responsive, interactive visualizations with smooth animations and real-time updates. Each component must be modular, reusable, and optimized for performance with proper memoization and lazy loading where appropriate.
